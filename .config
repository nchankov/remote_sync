# use this if you need to save bandwith as rsync to remote host would 
# need to send traffic
# this though would require double of the original folder space

# optional auto - if present and set to false it would require manual
# action on every sync. This would be useful if you are on limited 
# bandwith (mobile data)

# to the backup_path and then would sync with the remote. This way if there
# are some changes which were unsync they wont be overwriten by the initial sync
